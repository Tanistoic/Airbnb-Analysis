# 🏠 Airbnb Listing Analysis

## 📌 Introduction
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data containing key attributes such as listing prices, number of bedrooms, and location (via zip codes) captured throughout the year. While the dataset offers various metrics, this dashboard focuses on core business-impacting parameters to extract actionable insights.

Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard (attached in the project) that presents trends and insights to help users understand pricing patterns, demand distribution, and bedroom-wise availability and pricing.

## 🎯 Background
With the short-term rental market booming, platforms like Airbnb have become lucrative opportunities for homeowners. However, one of the key challenges remains: how to price your property smartly and when to list it to maximize revenue.

This project was born out of that curiosity to provide clear, data-backed answers using visualization. It aims to assist current or future Airbnb hosts in making informed decisions that directly impact their profitability.

## 🛠️ Tools I Used
Tableau Desktop for all charts, visualizations, and dashboard creation.

Excel for cleaning and pre-processing the data.

## 🔍 The Analysis
Here’s what I explored using Tableau:

Airbnb revenue trends across the year

Price and average price per zip code

Average price per number of bedrooms

Count of houses categorized by number of bedrooms

Each of these elements was visualized through clear, interactive dashboards to help surface key insights at a glance.

## 💡 What I Learned
Hands-on experience with data visualization in Tableau

Creating interactive dashboards that blend multiple dimensions (time, location, room size)

Storytelling through data in a way that makes it digestible for both analysts and non-technical users

## 📈 The Conclusion
This dashboard can be a valuable guide for property owners looking to list their homes on Airbnb. It helps answer:

When is the most profitable time of year to rent your home?

What price should you list it at based on your zip code?

How does the number of bedrooms influence pricing and availability?

With this information, homeowners can optimize their listings to attract guests while maximizing revenue.
